## Playing The Game
The goal of dustsweeper is to mark all of the spiders with flags.
The way to do this is to left click a square on the grid which will reveal what is under the dust.
If there is a spider you lose, otherwise it will be blank or reveal a number, the number informs the user of the number of spiders around that square, blank means there is 0.
If you think you know a square that contains a spider, you can flag it with a right click.
Good luck flagging the spiders!
